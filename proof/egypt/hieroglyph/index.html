		<h1>Proving the Hierogliphics</h1>

		<h2>What the Public Should Think</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="https://medude.github.io/aliens/images/helicopter.jpg">This image</a> is faked.
			The <a href="https://medude.github.io/aliens/images/original-helicopter.jpg">original</a>
			clearly shows that there is something attached to the nose of the
			helicopter and that for the faked image to exist, it must have been
			manipulated. This does not create any credibility and disproves
			that the image is of a helicopter.
			<a href="https://medude.github.io/aliens/images/helicopter-explination.gif">This image</a>
			shows how the "helicopter" is actually the result of a "typo" of
			sorts when some text was rewritten. The CIA has planted
			<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~A_U_R_A/abydos.html" target="_top">
			this</a> webpage to explain this to the public. Hopefully, the
			public will also incorrectly reason that, this being the only
			helicopter heirogliph in the whole of Egypt, the helicopter was
			probably some kind of mistake that was made by a scribe, or was
			simply a coincidence of some kind.
		</p>

		<h2>The Real, Actually True, Undeniably Not Fake, Truth</h2>
		<p>
			These hierogliphics are really, actually, for real, made of aliens.
			Alien helicopters landed in front of one Egyptian who then wrote
			about it for all eternity, but never told anyone, because there is
			only one record of the event anywhere, and was never read, for the
			same reason. Egyptologists are paid to never give this true
			explination. Those who tell the truth do not recive funding from
			the government, and we set things up to make them look bad, as
			though they are not reputable sources.
